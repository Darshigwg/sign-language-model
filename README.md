# Sign Language Detection Model

This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model for detecting sign language gestures. The model is trained to recognize various signs and interpret them into corresponding text or actions. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for running it.

## Introduction

Sign language is a vital means of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Developing a robust sign language detection model can facilitate better communication and accessibility for this community. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to recognize and interpret sign language gestures in real-time.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python (version X.X)
- Anaconda or Miniconda (optional but recommended)
- TensorFlow (version X.X)
- OpenCV (version X.X)
- Other dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darshigwg/sign-language-model.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
   cd sign-language-model
